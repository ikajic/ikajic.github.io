I am the organzier of the programming workshops for students in non-STEM fields
at the University of Waterloo. The workshop materials are available
[here](https://github.com/uwpyb/materials). So far there have been four such
workshops in Jan '16, Nov '16, Nov '17 and June '18.
Instructors and mentors at the workshop are current and former UW students, and
we are all volunteers. 


At the University of Waterloo, I was a teaching assistant for the following
courses:
- <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs116/">CS116</a> Introduction
  to Computer Science 2 (Winter Term 2018)
- <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs240/w18/">CS240</a> Data
  Structures and Data Management (Fall Term 2017)
- <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs343/">CS343</a> Concurrent and Parallel Programming (Fall Term 2016)

I am also an instructor at [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
workshops that teach basic programming skills for scientific computing.
