I am the organzier of the programming workshops for students in non-STEM fields at the University of Waterloo. 
The workshop materials are available [here](https://github.com/uwpyb/materials).
So far there have been two such workshops in January and November, both in 2016.

I am also an instructor at [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
workshops that teach basic programming skills for scientific computing.

At the University of Waterloo, I was a teaching assistant for the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs343/">CS343 course</a> on Concurrent and Parallel Programming during Winter Term 2017.
