I am the organzier of the programming workshop that took place in January 2016
for students in non-STEM fields at the University of Waterloo. The materials
from our first workshop are available
[here](https://github.com/uwpyb/materials).

I am also an instructor at [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
workshops that teach basic programming skills for scientific computing.
