I am the organzier of the programming workshops for students in non-STEM fields at the University of Waterloo. 
The workshop materials are available [here](https://github.com/uwpyb/materials).
So far there have been three such workshops in Jan 2016, Nov 2016 and Nov 2017.
The next one is scheduled for June 2018.

At the University of Waterloo, I was a teaching assistant for the following
courses:
- <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs116/">CS116</a> Introduction
  to Computer Science 2 (Winter Term 2018)
- <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs240/w18/">CS240</a> Data
  Structures and Data Management (Fall Term 2017)

I am also an instructor at [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
