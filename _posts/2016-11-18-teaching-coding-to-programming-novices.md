title: "Teaching coding to programming novices"

There is hardly a teaching experience I enjoy more than teaching programming to
complete novices. Sharing my knowledge to allow others to do the same thing
I enjoy doing is certainly a part of what makes it so special. However, there is
more to it than sharing of knowledge and enthusiasm that surrounds it: for me, it is
inexplicably satisfying to observe the metamorphosis of an average computer user into
a powerful creator called a programmer.

Last week, together with a group of five mentors, two instructors, 30 motivated
students and the support from my university and Google for Education program,
I had the pleasure of organizing a programming workshop for complete beginners.
I have organized a <a href="https://math.uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/news/python-workshop-beginners-proves-successful">similar workshop</a> in January this year and the feedback was
useful in determining what teaching practices work the best: participants loved high
mentor-to-student ratio (1:5), online slides, hands-on projects and Software
Carpentry-style red/green sticky notes. These practices proved to be useful
once again!

Participants were students in majors who do not have an easy access to
programming education  (e.g. Arts, Environment, Applied Health Sciences,
Biology etc.). Usually, it is the upper-year undergraduates who notice that
programming is a skill useful for their studies (and future, whatever it might
be), but their curriculum leaves little leeway for learning how to code. Even
if they managed to attend a CS course, it might be hard to follow as such
courses usually assume some CS background and familiarity with how computers
work. The goal of this workshop was to introduce programming to students who
otherwise wouldn't have an opportunity to do so and give them a nudge in the
right direction so they feel more confident in taking CS courses in the future.


The workshop was very <a href="https://github.com/uwpyb/materials">intense</a>,
covering Friday evening, Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 3pm. <a
href="http://uwpyb.github.io/materials/lectures/day_0.slides#/">Friday</a> was
reserved for installing <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"> Anaconda</a>, learning simple shell navigation, learning
programming basics such as variables, basic data types and demistifying the
role of  the “black-screen” as seen in every single "hacking" scene in every TV
show ever (ok, fine, there are <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU">some exceptions</a>). Also,
the goal was to familiarize ourselves with IPython and Sublime Text (a combo
which has worked pretty well) and explore different kinds of errors Python
might be throwing. Morning <a
href="https://uwpyb.github.io/materials/lectures/day_1.slides#/">sessions </a> on
Saturday covered flow control, conditionals, lists and dictionaries, with
afternoon dedicated to a project designing a <a
href="https://github.com/uwpyb/materials/blob/master/projects/Day1_Quiz.ipynb">quiz</a>.
On <a
href="http://uwpyb.github.io/materials/lectures/day_2.slides#/">Sunday</a>, we
taught functions, Numpy and Matplotlib with afternoon reserved for climate <a
href="https://github.com/uwpyb/materials/blob/master/projects/Day2_DataAnalysis.ipynb">data
analysis project</a>. Lots of things in such a short period of time, but with
the right level of focus, tasty lunches and coffee breaks, we managed to get
the maximum out of it. In the future, we will dedicate more time to exercises
and will drop Python dictionaries which turned out to be confusing for
beginners (and nearly to impossible to understand in conjunction with for
loops).

According to the feedback collected in the post-workshop survey, all
participants felt more confident in taking introductory CS courses after
participating in the workshop. Over 80% found programming less intimidating
than before the workshop and we scared off 8% who said they find it somewhat more
intimidating than before the workshop (I'm quite sure it's the for loops!). Overall, our lectures, projects, instructors, mentors,
curriculum and the diversity in the classroom was rated mostly excellent and
good and everyone would recommend the workshop to others. Plenty of reasons to be happy
:)


Personally, I was astonished to receive an email from a participant who created
a small Python script that scans a folder for pdf files, looks for a particular word
in each of them and merges all pages containing that word in a single pdf file.
Starting with lectures which explain why is a=3 a legit thing to do, but 3=a is
not, and finishing with a script like this is a gigantic step in the universe
of coding. Many students said they wished the workshop to be longer because
*there is just so much awesome stuff to learn*. Because I agree with that, my
future plans include extending the workshop for a few hours (to start with),
and continuing to keep entertaining curious minds such as this one (quote from
a participant):


*My favorite part of the workshop was the fact that it opened up a whole new
world for me. For someone who had never coded before it was an excellent
introductory experience. Perhaps it would be difficult for people to think one
weekend can change a persons life, but for a naturally curious person such as
my self it has. I never thought it would happen, but lately, anytime I hear
about a cool new feature or even when I am on the internet, my mind always
asks: "Oh I wonder what the code for this is?"*
