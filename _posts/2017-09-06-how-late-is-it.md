Motivated by the book I am currently reading (*Constructing a language* by Tomasello),
I have initially intended to write about the origins of language and language
universals. However, seems like the spirit of summer still lingers over me, so
I decided to write about cross-language expressions that can be heard in a bar
or on the beach during those hot summer days.

One of my preferred ways to kill time on highways while driving south to reach the Adriatic coast 
is to guess where people come from based on their licence plates.
Arguably, this can be fun for a few minutes, but as soon as the "harder" ones
are cracked (*LV* is Latvia, *UA* is Ukraine and not United Arab Emirates) this becomes rather repetitive as
most tourists come from the same European countries.

A more interesting version of this game is to  guess where people come
from based on what they said, especially when things they said sound a bit odd. While guessing based on their accent can usually be pretty accurate, in a written language reverse engineering the original language of a sentence or a phrase can be
quite a challenge. A tourist looking for an *otel* is probably looking for
a hotel as the letter *h* is not pronounced in French. Sometimes it is hard
to *ear* those words (to quote my French teacher). A person might appear in a rush when asking "How late is it?"
though they are probably just asking for time since "Wie sp√§t ist es?" is a way
to do so in German. Also, if someone says that humid weather is making them
*ready*, it probably means that it is  making them feel exhausted and tired (i.e.
something like *done*, from German *fertig*).
In such a state (and there were many of those this summer), they might want to move to be under
a *shadow*, which means they are probably looking for a bit of *shade* (in German 
that's the same word: der Schatten).

One of my favorite expressions is: "I only understand train station". It is a literal translation of the German phrase "Ich
verstehe nur Bahnhof", which is used in situations where one has no clue what
is going on (e.g., in a conversation). I thought this one might mean something
along the lines "I am lost in this city and the only word I know is *train
station* which is where I came from", but the Internet says it has to do with
tired WW1 soldiers who associated train stations with going home, so in that
state "train station" was the only word they could/wanted to  hear in
a conversation.

Although *saltery* might sound like a valid translation of
the Croatian word *solana* it does have a very different meaning, so a *salt
factory* might be more accurate. Talking about *hungry
eyes* when seeing someone ordering way more food they can eat makes sense in
Croatian, but such
a phrase can  easily confuse English speakers (and apparently is well known to
fans of Dirty Dancing, though, in a very different context). Ordering "kava s mlijekom" will get you a coffee with
milk in Zagreb, but on the coast people might correct you and ask if you want
a "macchiato" (or as locals would write it, *makijato*) which is an Italian
word meaning *marked* or *stained*. Finally, Croatian, being a Slavic language,
does not have articles so occasionally they might slip from a sentence, such as when I ask my
friend to "pass me book".
