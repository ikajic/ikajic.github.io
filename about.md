### about me

I'm a researcher studying computational mechanisms underlying cognitive
functions and behaviours pertaining to natural language. The ability to
communicate using language is uniquely human, and it is realized by networks of
hundreds of millions of neurons in the brain. In my PhD thesis, I investigated
how aspects of linguistic function could be realized in the brain by using
biologically constrained neural networks. 

I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2020 at the University of Waterloo in
Canada, where I was a student in the [Computational Neuroscience Research group
(CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/). I received my Master's degree in Computational Neuroscience from the [Bernstein
Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/) in
Berlin, and my undergraduate degree from [FER](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/) at
the University of Zagreb. 
My (occasionally updated) CV is available
[here](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/ivana-cv.pdf){:target="_new"}.


#### my name
I come from Croatia, which is a small beautiful country in the Mediterranean
whose contours on a map, some people say, look a bit like those of a bird in
flight (imagining Istria as the bird's head). To pronounce my name as a Croatian
would, try saying E-va [sounds like "va" in lava]-na ["na" like in retina] Ka-[sounds like "ca" in
cartoon]-yeech. Croatians speak Croatian, which is a Slavic language and
contains lovely vowelless words such as trg (town square), vrh (peak) and
Krk (name of an island). Instead of getting lost while trying to find a trg on
a vrh at Krk, one can also visit [Plitviƒçka Jezera](http://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/), [Dubrovnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik) or [Paklenica](http://www.np-paklenica.hr/en/).
