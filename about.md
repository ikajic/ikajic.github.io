### about me

<img src="../files/me.jpeg" style="float:right;width:188px;height:225px;padding-left:10px">

I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo working in
the [Computational Neuroscience Research group
(CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/) headed by Chris Eliasmith. My interests
are in cognitively constrained representations of language. In particular,
I investigate distributed representations of the linguistic content such as
words and sentences that can be efficiently implemented in large-scale neural networks while capturing different aspects of linguistic behaviours as observed with users of natural language.
To do so, I use a compressed, vector-based representations of words and
sentences called [semantic pointers](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/spa.html) that can be manipulated to mimic aspects of
syntactic and semantic processing.
In my research, I am also investigating how vectors learned from big corpora of
text compare to representations derived from much smaller, empirically derived
datasets.
In 2018 I did a four month internship as a Software Reliability Engineering
(SRE) intern at Google, where I designed and implemented a system for
detection of automation errors from log data.

I received a master's degree in Computational Neuroscience at the [Bernstein
Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/) in
Berlin and my Bachelor in Computing from [FER](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/) at
the University of Zagreb. I also worked as a Research Fellow in the [Cognovo
group](http://cognovo.eu/) at Plymouth University in England. 
My (occasionally updated) CV is available
[here](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/ivana-cv-nov18.pdf){:target="_new"}.


#### my name
I come from Croatia, which is a small beautiful country in the Mediterranean
whose contours on a map, some people say, look a bit like those of a bird in
flight (imagining Istria as the bird's head). To pronounce my name as a Croatian
would, try saying E-va [sounds like "va" in lava]-na ["na" like in retina] Ka-[sounds like "ca" in
cartoon]-yeech. Croatians speak Croatian, which is a Slavic language and
contains lovely vowelless words such as trg (town square), vrh (peak) and
Krk (name of an island). Instead of getting lost while trying to find a trg on
a vrh at Krk, one can also visit [Plitviƒçka Jezera](http://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/), [Dubrovnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik) or [Paklenica](http://www.np-paklenica.hr/en/).
