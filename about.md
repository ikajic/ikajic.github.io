### about me

<img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2485670?v=3&s=460" style="float:right;width:188px;height:188px;padding-left:10px">

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Google Deepmind in Montreal, Canada. I am interested in applying methods and techniques from cognitive science in analysis and characterization of behavior of machine learning models. Specifically, this includes designing evaluation protocols, benchmarks and metrics to comprehensively understand capabilities and limitations of large vision-language models that in recent years have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of tasks. More recently, I have been studying how well image generation models understand numbers and quantities.


I completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2020 at the University of Waterloo in
Canada, where I was a student in the [Computational Neuroscience Research group
(CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/). I received my Master's degree in Computational Neuroscience from the [Bernstein
Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/) in
Berlin, and my undergraduate degree from [FER](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/) at
the University of Zagreb. 
My (occasionally updated) CV is available
[here](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/ivana-cv.pdf){:target="_new"}.


#### my name
I come from Croatia, which is a small beautiful country in the Mediterranean
whose contours on a map, some people say, look a bit like those of a bird in
flight (imagining Istria as the bird's head). To pronounce my name as a Croatian
would, try saying E-va [sounds like "va" in lava]-na ["na" like in retina] Ka-[sounds like "ca" in
cartoon]-yeech. Croatians speak Croatian, which is a Slavic language and
contains lovely vowelless words such as trg (town square), vrh (peak) and
Krk (name of an island). Instead of getting lost while trying to find a trg on
a vrh at Krk, one can also visit [Plitviƒçka Jezera](http://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/), [Dubrovnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik) or [Paklenica](http://www.np-paklenica.hr/en/).
