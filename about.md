### about me

<img src="../files/me.jpeg" style="float:right;width:188px;height:225px;padding-left:10px">

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo working in
the [Computational Neuroscience Research group
(CNRG)](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/) headed by Chris Eliasmith. My interests
are in biologically constrained representations of language. In particular,
I investigate distributed representations of the linguistic content such as
words and sentences that can be implemented efficiently in a network of spiking neurons. 

I received a Master's degree in Computational Neuroscience at the [Bernstein
Centre for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/Home/) in
Berlin and my Bachelor in Computing from [FER](http://www.fer.unizg.hr/) at
the University of Zagreb. I also worked as a Research Fellow in a [Cognovo
group](http://cognovo.eu/) at Plymouth University in England investigating
creative verbal thinking. My CV is available
[here](https://github.com/ikajic/ikajic.github.io/raw/master/files/cv.pdf).
